    <h2 style="text-align: center">About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Kevin, a Lead Developer with 10 years of extensive experience developing and maintaining
        web applications using modern technologies
        such as React, Typescript, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgresQL, Docker, and Amazon Web Services. </p>
    <p>The goal of this project was to learn Python and leverage a few commonly used resources/libraries.</p>
    <h4>Resources Learned/Used:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numpy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandas</a>

            <h3>Graph 1: Total Primary Language Usage</h3>
            <p>In the Matplotlib Bar graph provided, the total utilization of coding languages throughout GitHub <a
                    href="https://github.com/kalewis5331"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repositories</a> is
                visualized.
                Each bar represents the total percentage of a specific language, with the height of the bar
                indicating the relative magnitude of usage.
                From the graph, we can observe that Java has the highest usage, followed by JavaScript. This
                visualization enables hiring managers, recruiters, and developers to quickly grasp
                the comparative usage of different
                coding languages and identify areas for further analysis or improvement.</p>
            <p><b>Note:</b> Private Repos from prior work experience would have significantly altered the data, placing
                TypeScript as the highest language due to the sheer amount of coding done in that language.
            </p>
            <p><b>Note: </b>Figure below only shows the Primary Languages per Repository, and does not show
                secondary/additional languages used.

            <h3>Graph 2: Percentage of Languages Used (per Repo)</h3>
            <p>In the Matplotlib Multi Bar graph provided, the total utilization of coding languages throughout an
                individual Repository is
                visualized.
                Each bar represents the total percentage of a specific language, with the height of the bar
                indicating the relative magnitude of usage.
                From the graph, we can observe that Vue has the highest usage, followed by TypeScript. This
                visualization enables hiring managers, recruiters, and developers to quickly grasp
                the comparative usage of different coding languages and identify areas for further analysis or
                improvement.</p>
            <p><b>Note: </b>According to the team behind <a
                    href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue</a>, Vue is a JavaScript framework that builds on top
                of
                standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. GitHub's API classifies it as a Language.
